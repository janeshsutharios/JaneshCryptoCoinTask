#  About Domain Layer 
Domain Layer(Business logic) is the inner-most part of the onion (without dependencies to other layers, it is totally isolated). It contains Entities(Business Models), Use Cases, and Repository Interfaces. This layer could be potentially reused within different projects. Such separation allows for not using the host app within the test target because no dependencies (also 3rd party) are needed — this makes the Domain Use Cases tests take just a few seconds. Note: Domain Layer should not include anything from other layers(e.g Presentation — UIKit or SwiftUI or Data Layer — Mapping Codable)
